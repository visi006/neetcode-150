USING SLIDING WINDOW APPRAOCH:

PROBLEM STATEMENT :


Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
0 <= k <= nums.length




JAVA CODE :

class Solution {
    public int longestOnes(int[] nums, int k) {
        int left = 0;
        int ans = 0;
        int window = 0;
        int n = nums.length;

        for(int right = 0; right<n;right++){
            window = window + nums[right];
        
        while(window + k < right - left + 1){
            window = window - nums[left];
            left++;
        }
        ans = Math.max(ans,right-left+1);
    }
    
    return ans;
}
}
