USING TWO POINTER APPROACH WE CAN SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.

PROBLEM STATEMENT :

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 100
0 <= t.length <= 104
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.





JAVA CODE IS GIVEN BY : 

class Solution {

    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {

        if (s.length() == 0) {
            return true;
        }

        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;

        while (i < s.length() && j < t.length()) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j)) {
                i++;
            }
            j++;
        }

        return i == s.length();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();

        String s = "abc";
        String t = "ahbgdc";

        System.out.println(sol.isSubsequence(s, t));
    }
}
